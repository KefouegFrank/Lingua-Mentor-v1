"""BullMQ processor: srs_batch_generation.

Fires at 2AM UTC from the Job Scheduler the gateway upserts (ADR 0009 §2.7).
Fans out rather than generating inline: a thousand learners at ~3s each is an
hour inside one job, where a single learner's failure retries all of them.

Carries no payload — the active-learner set is read here, at run time.
